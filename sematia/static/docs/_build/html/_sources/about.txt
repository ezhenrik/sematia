Sematia is a platform to create and manage layers based on linguistic variants in EpiDoc TEI XML documents. It also acts as the database for storing (and eventually, querying) morpho-syntactic annotations of each layer, created using the `Arethusa annotation framework <http://www.perseids.org/tools/arethusa/app/#/>`_. The project aims to make it possible to:

* search for morpho-syntactic differences between layers
* analyze syntactic structures within layers
* combine the above with metadata describing each document

The project's source is hosted `on GitHub <https://github.com/ezhenrik/sematia/>`_.
